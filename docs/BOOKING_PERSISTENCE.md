# Booking Persistence Feature

## Overview

The EJA Homestay platform now includes a booking persistence feature that preserves user booking details (dates, room selections, guest counts) when users are prompted to sign in during the booking process.

## Problem Solved

**Before**: Users would lose their booking details when clicking "Book Now & Pay" without being signed in, requiring them to re-enter all information after authentication.

**After**: Users' booking details are automatically preserved and restored after successful authentication, providing a seamless booking experience.

## How It Works

### 1. **Data Storage**
When an unauthenticated user clicks "Book Now & Pay":
- Booking details are stored in `sessionStorage`
- User is redirected to sign-in page with a success message
- Data includes: check-in/out dates, room selections, guest counts, special requests

### 2. **Authentication Flow**
- User signs in normally
- Authentication success triggers automatic data restoration
- User is redirected back to the property page

### 3. **Data Restoration**
- Booking form automatically detects stored data
- All form fields are populated with previous selections
- Success toast confirms data restoration
- User can proceed directly to payment

## Technical Implementation

### Components Involved

1. **`useBookingPersistence` Hook** (`src/hooks/useBookingPersistence.ts`)
   - Manages booking data storage and retrieval
   - Handles data expiration (1 hour timeout)
   - Provides clean API for components

2. **`AuthContext`** (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)
   - Added `onAuthSuccess` callback mechanism
   - Triggers data restoration after authentication
   - Manages authentication state changes

3. **`BookingForm`** (`src/components/BookingForm.tsx`)
   - Uses the persistence hook
   - Automatically restores data when user is authenticated
   - Shows success message when data is restored

### Data Structure

```typescript
interface BookingData {
  formData: {
    checkIn: string;
    checkOut: string;
    rooms: number;
    adults: number;
    children: number;
    specialRequests: string;
  };
  roomSelections: { [roomId: string]: number };
  propertyId: string;
  timestamp: number;
}
```

## User Experience Flow

### Scenario: Unauthenticated User Booking

1. **User selects booking details**:
   - Chooses check-in/out dates
   - Selects room types and quantities
   - Sets guest count
   - Adds special requests

2. **User clicks "Book Now & Pay"**:
   - System detects user is not authenticated
   - Booking data is stored in sessionStorage
   - Success message: "Please sign in to complete your booking. Your details will be saved."
   - User is redirected to sign-in page

3. **User signs in**:
   - Normal authentication process
   - After successful sign-in, user is redirected back to property page

4. **Data restoration**:
   - Booking form automatically detects stored data
   - All fields are populated with previous selections
   - Success message: "Your booking details have been restored!"
   - User can proceed directly to payment

1. **Check Console**: Look for error messages in browser console
2. **Clear Storage**: Clear sessionStorage and try again
3. **Browser Compatibility**: Ensure modern browser support
4. **Network Issues**: Check for connectivity problems
