  className="custom-styles"
/>
```

## Customization

### Adding New Destinations

To add new destinations, edit the `DESTINATIONS` array in `DestinationAutocomplete.tsx`:

```tsx
const DESTINATIONS = [
  { name: 'New City', state: 'State Name', country: 'Country' },
  // ... existing destinations
];
```

### Styling

The component accepts a `className` prop for custom styling:

```tsx
<DestinationAutocomplete
  className="border-red-500 focus:ring-red-500"
/>
```

### Behavior Customization

Key behaviors can be modified:
- **Max Results**: Change `filtered.slice(0, 8)` to show more/fewer results
- **Default Suggestions**: Modify the empty state to show different suggestions
- **Search Logic**: Update the filtering logic for different matching behavior

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. **Recent Searches**: Remember and suggest recent searches
2. **Popular Destinations**: Show trending destinations first
3. **Category Filtering**: Filter by region or property type
4. **Search History**: Persistent search history across sessions
5. **Voice Input**: Speech-to-text for destination entry

- âœ… Mouse interaction (click, hover)
- âœ… Mobile responsiveness
- âœ… Accessibility (screen readers)
- âœ… Edge cases (empty input, no matches)

## Support
